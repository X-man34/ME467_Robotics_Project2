python 3.12.8

    pip install numpy, spatialmath-python, pandas, flask, requests, mujoco\
    
    on linuix additional shenanigans may be needed, to get plt.show() to work.  installing tkinter with sudo apt-get install python3-tk worked on my system, 
    but with my limited knowledge of linuix, i don't know what may or may not be needed to get stuff to work on other systems. 
    Disabling 3D visuailizations also does not appear to close the viewer on linuix. 


See the reports folder for a flawed export of the report. Tried to do it in markdown, and for some reason could not get the math to render.
